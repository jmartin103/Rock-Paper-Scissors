# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple game of Rock Paper Scissors, where the computer generates a random number from 1 to 3. The user enters a number from 1 to 3, as well. The game is played, and then the user is told whether they lose, win, or if it is a draw. The user is then asked if they want to play again. If y is entered, then the game restarts; otherwise, the game is terminated.
